    When CLI Clear vision logs

#    Given CLI simulate 100 attacks of type "testUDPAttack" on "DefensePro" 185 with loopDelay 15000 and wait 120 seconds
    Given CLI simulate 100 attacks of type "testUDPAttack" on SetId "DefensePro_Set_7" with loopDelay 15000 and wait 120 seconds with attack ID

  @SID_3
