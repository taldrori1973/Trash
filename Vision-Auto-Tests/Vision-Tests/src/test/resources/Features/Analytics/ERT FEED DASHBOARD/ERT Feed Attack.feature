  Scenario: Run DP simulator PCAPs for EAAF widgets and arrange the data for automation needs
    When CLI simulate 1 attacks of type "ErtFeed_GeoFeed" on "DefensePro" 11 and wait 20 seconds
    Then CLI copy "/home/radware/Scripts/EAAF_attacksTimeSpreadingScript.sh" from "GENERIC_LINUX_SERVER" to "ROOT_SERVER_CLI" "/"
    # copy script that keeps the attacks times in relation to system current time
    Then CLI copy "/home/radware/Scripts/EAAF_KeepAttacksTimesUpToDate.sh" from "GENERIC_LINUX_SERVER" to "ROOT_SERVER_CLI" "/"
    # run the script of attacks data time modification
    Then CLI Run remote linux Command "/EAAF_attacksTimeSpreadingScript.sh" on "ROOT_SERVER_CLI" with timeOut 1800
    # run the script of attacks data time update according to current system time.Scenario:
    # NOTE: this script can be stopped at the end of this test file but it's not mandatory
    Then CLI Run remote linux Command "nohup /EAAF_KeepAttacksTimesUpToDate.sh" on "ROOT_SERVER_CLI"
