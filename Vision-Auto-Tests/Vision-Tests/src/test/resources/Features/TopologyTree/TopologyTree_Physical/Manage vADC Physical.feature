  @SID_1
  Scenario: Login and clean logs
    Given CLI Reset radware password
    Given UI Login with user "radware" and password "radware"
    Then UI Go To Vision
    Then CLI Clear vision logs

  @SID_2
  Scenario: Add VX Alteon
#    Then UI Add physical "Alteon" with index 6 on "Default (Physical)" site
    Then UI open Topology Tree view "SitesAndClusters" site
    Then UI open Topology Tree view "PhysicalContainers" site
#    Then UI Wait For Device To Show Up In The Topology Tree physical "Alteon" device with index 6 with timeout 180 seconds
  @SID_3

    Then UI open Topology Tree view "SitesAndClusters" site
    Then UI Lock Device "Alteon_Set_5" under "Sites And Devices"
    Then UI Timeout in seconds "30"
    Then UI verify Device Status "Alteon_Set_5" if Expected device Status "Up or Maintenance"
