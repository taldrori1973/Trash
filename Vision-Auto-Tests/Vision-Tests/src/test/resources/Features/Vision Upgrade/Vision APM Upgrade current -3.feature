       #for testing AVA Attack Capacity Grace Period with the following scenario:
      # if before upgrade the server not have the Legacy "vision-reporting-module-AMS" license and never installs the new AVA License so after upgrade No  Grace Period will be given:
    Given REST Vision DELETE License Request "vision-AVA-6-Gbps-attack-capacity"
    And REST Vision DELETE License Request "vision-AVA-20-Gbps-attack-capacity"
    And REST Vision DELETE License Request "vision-AVA-60-Gbps-attack-capacity"
